Wrap of plugins that I have worked on.

Some of them are basically a remake of other plugin and just tweaked to change the main outcome of the plugin.

List:
* **sm-medic**: 
    This plugin is a shortcut to restore backup rounds, by just saying `.medic <round_number>` (only for admins)
* **sm-cfgLauncher**: 
    Shortcuts executions of CFGs from the server side, for example the custom practice server, will be launched with `.practice` (only for admins)
* **sm-forceDefaultAgents**: 
    In case of having non-default agents, it will swap them on spawn to a default one, to follow league's rules, like ESEA. ***This plugin its the agent-chooser plugin but tweaked (from Fr4nug)***
